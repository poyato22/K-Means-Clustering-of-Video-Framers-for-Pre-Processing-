# K-Means-Clustering-of-Video-Framers-for-Pre-Processing-
This program detects a target-colored object in video frames, crops a centered region, and converts it to HSV histogram features. Frames are clustered with k-means++ using silhouette scoring, and the most representative frame from each cluster is saved as a keyframe summary.
